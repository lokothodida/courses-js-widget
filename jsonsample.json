          "description": "Course aim:\nTo provide participants with information about resources that will help them to prepare high quality manuscripts with increased likelihood of acceptance in health research journals. (High impact journals such as the BMJ, Lancet and JAMA are increasingly requesting adherence to relevant reporting guidelines).\nTo increase participant awareness of the crucial importance of organising health research to ensure quality in both its conduct and reporting and data sharing.\n\nCourse format:\nAn introductory level workshop, aimed at DPhil students Post Docs and research staff undertaking research within departments carrying out laboratory-based or human health/clinical research who are seeking guidance about organising their research for publication.\n\nCourse content:\nThe workshop places research publication within a wider context of issues regarding research conduct, publication ethics and evidence based health-care and will complement other sessions such as research ethics.\n\nThe workshop will cover the following key issues:\n- The role/functions of the research publication. A publication is often the only tangible record the research was done; it needs to describe the study clearly, accurately and fully so it can be used for further research and evidence-based patient care.\n- Poor reporting and its consequences. It has become increasingly clear that there are many ways in which health research is poorly reported. These may result in unethical, wasteful and possibly even harmful clinical consequences. These issues will be discussed.\n- How to achieve high quality of your manuscripts. Participants will be introduced to the ideas of publication ethics and reporting guidelines (RG). They will be given information about where to find helpful resources for their own use such as the EQUATOR Network's free online resource library. The workshop will introduce the more commonly used reporting guidelines such as CONSORT, PRISMA and STROBE.\n- Funders' have called for standardization of shared datasets to facilitate their interpretation. In response there have been a 'wealth' of community-developed reporting requirements in biology. Participants will be introduced to (i) the BioSharing (www.biosharing.org) initiative aiming to catalogue reporting requirements, terminologies and exchange formats, and (ii) ISAcommons (www.isacommons.org) an example of a community  network working to empower more scientists to take data management and sharing into their own hands, using a community standard.\n\nThe EQUATOR Network is an 'umbrella' organisation that brings together researchers, medical journal editors, peer reviewers, developers of reporting guidelines, research funding bodies and other collaborators with a mutual interest in improving the quality of health research publications and of research itself. The EQUATOR website provides guidance facilitating publication of research studies which includes a comprehensive collection of reporting guidelines http://www.equator-network.org/\n\n\nCourse length\n2.5 hours\n\nParticipant numbers\n25",

          "description": "Course aims\nThis course is aimed at researchers with a basic working knowledge of statistics, who are/will be required to carry out statistical analysis in the course of their research. It aims to introduce,\n1. the principles and methods of statistics in the fields of biology and the medical sciences.\n2. the available statistical tools for use in these fields.\n3. the computer package 'SPSS' for statistical analysis.\n(It is not expected that, in a short course, you will become proficient in analysis, but you will appreciate what statistics can do and you will learn what issues need to be addressed in data collection and analysis). \n\nCourse format\nA course consists of five sessions. Each of these two hour sessions will include a 45 minute lecture followed by a practical.\n\nCourse content\nOverview :\n Stages of statistical analysis.\n SPSS.\n Sample selection.\n Types of data and types of distributions.\n\nExploratory data analysis: ways of presenting data :\n Tables .\n 'Summary statistics' for describing data numerically.\n(e.g. For measuring mean, skewness, spread of data etc.)\n Histograms, frequency plots, boxplots, scatterplots.\n\nStatistical inference :\nEstimation .\nConfidence intervals.\nPrinciples of hypothesis testing.\n\nZ-tests and t-tests :\nExtends the comparison of two sets of data from large data sets (studied in the first year) to the small data sets more often met in real research.\n\nAnalysis of Variance(ie 'ANOVA') and Chi2 tests :\nComparisons between more than two sets of data (ANOVA).\nUse of Chi2 to test categorical data (that is data such as 'how many people received the new drug, how many were cured, how many died').\n\nLinear regression :\nHow to draw the best line of fit to data.\nHow to describe how well the data fit the line, and how reliable the line could be in predictions.\n\nCourse length :\nFive sessions over one week, two hours each day.\n\n\nParticipant numbers :\n25 - 35",
